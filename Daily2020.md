#### 2020/5/23 My first day to use MarkdownPad ;)
Cause I'm going to do an intern in HikVision soon .(actually in June 1st) To prepare, I decide to be more familiar with ROS, Linux and CMake.

最近在看***SegMatch***。看完感觉想法十分简洁，中间很少的公式推导。所以准备先把代码跑起来，在这个过程中复习一哈ROS。

Finally succeeded to build tensorflow from source and now waiting to download datasets of segmap.
Things should know before building tensorflow from source:
* Be sure with the correspondence between the version of ***tensorflow*** and ***bazel***;
* Due to the Internet restriction, better to download the .sh file of bazel;

About ROS
* catkin clean restores the workspace and let you be able to rebuild from scratch.
